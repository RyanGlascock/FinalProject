# Making a basic Home Page in html

> My name is Ryan Glascock. The reason I wanted to create this tutorial is to give anyone who is starting off in html a head start. It can be confusing at time to start a new programming language so getting the basics can be a major help. My target audience is mainly older highschool students or young college students that are just starting out in web design.
